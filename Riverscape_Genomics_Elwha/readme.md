### This is a readme for the scripts for my investigation of the consequences of recolonization of up-river habitat on the Elwha River by lower river, steelehad
The scripts and pipeline in this directory will include my testing of hypotheses for life-history specific selection on rainbow trout/steelhead on the Elwha River

Specifically, I want to ID signals of local adaptation as they vary across life history stage and phenotype as these fish experience very different local environmental conditions due to the extent of their movement/migration across life history stages.

This study will include RADSequenced individuals from the Elwha River prior to, during and post-dam removal across trout fry, smolt/juvenile and adult life-history stages from known rainbow and steelhead trout forms.
