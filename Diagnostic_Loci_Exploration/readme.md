### This is a readme for the scripts for my exploration and generation of diagnostic loci 
The scripts and pipeline in this directory will include my exploration, testing and verification of RAD and non-RAD loci that can be used to delineate F1 and post-F1 hybrids.

Specifically, we will be trying to differentiate interspecific coastal cutthroat trout and rainbow/steelhead trout as well as native origin and hatchery origin rainbow/steelhead trout.

This study will include refernce individuals from the Elwha River, the Skagit River basin, the Cowlitz Hatchery and Kristensen and Koop et al. ( ).
