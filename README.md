# Alex Fraik's "ReadME" File for all projects associated with my postdoctoral fellowships

## Here are all of the directories with my code across all of my projects outside of my PhD work during my postdoc (2021-2023) at the University of Idaho and at NOAA NMFS
In this directory I have placed all of the files and scripts generated for published works

## Below are all of different projects I have worked on and the location of the code
1. Riverscape genomics of Oncorhynchus mykiss on the Elwha River
