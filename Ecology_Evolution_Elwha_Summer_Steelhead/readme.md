### This is a readme for the scripts for investigating the actions that contributed to the recovery of summer steelhead on the Elwha River

In this study, we want to ID the major points of evidence for the cumulative recovery actions that lead to the resurgence of summer steelhead rapidly following dam removal in the Elwha River watershed

This is a follow up study to the Fraik et al. (2021) population genetics study looking at the population dynamics of steelhead recovery on the Elwha River
