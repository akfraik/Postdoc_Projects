### This is a readme for the scripts for the population genetics of isolated bull trout populations

In this study, Jim Nagler and Paul Hohenlohe wanted to investigate the population genetics of recovering bull trout in the Clearwater River basin

Specifically, they wanted to determine whether a pair of geographically proximate populations were truly isolated or whether there was some gene flow that was not detectable via alternative, non-genetic methods

Additional work to investigate these patterns in the Pashimeroi River basin is currently being considered as a paired sampling location

The work would contribute to the greater evolutionary/conservation genetics question of how do small populations evolve, and remain extant, in spite of lack of novel gene flow and high levels of inbreeding
